## Mimic

### JCO
This repo is one of my progress on [_Frondend Roadmap_](https://www.codementor.io/kamranahmedse/modern-frontend-developer-in-2018-inb3ay6xt) to duplicate some website

I choose **jcodonuts.com/id** because I know it and I really happy when my friend bring this donuts for free even though I have never bought it by myself

In this repo, I challenge my self to develop my skill, its like:

- **Jumbotron Image Slider:** I really curious about Jumbotron Image Slider and I think _jco_ using _nivo slider_ to manage it, when I searching about it, I found the dead end 
because _nivo slider_ is not for free, so I try another options and I choose _Owl Carousel_ to make Image Slider
- **Single Page Application:** When my friend tell me about SPA (_Single Page Application_) Angular, I challenge my self to create SPA just using _javascript_ 
and I did make it with helping from `window.location` attribute

### Github
I've try to mimic github profile page include with some control, but not real control. I made github mimic as much as posible to look like real one

## Math

### Prime Number
In general, you can define a number as a prime number if it's only have two factor, that is 1 and it's self

I'll give you some example: 
```
factor number 2 is 1 and 2
factor number 7 is 1 and 7
factor number 19 is 1 and 19
...etc
```
When you want to check a number is prime or not, 
let _p_ be a number you wanna to test, you need iteration program to test from 1 to _p_ to divided _p_
if more than two number can divided _p_ than _p_ is not prime
otherwise _p_ is prime

I made a program to check prime number, I'm not using iteration program above, 
but I'll check prime number using [_Sieve Method_](https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Sieve_method), it will check prime number really fast

You can check my program in [here](https://codepen.io/colorcreate/pen/BOzKXq), if it's prime, it will tell you that it's prime number,
but when it's not prime, it will show you factors of it's number

### Prime Count
It's like _Prime Number Program_ but it's find the next prime number from input.
I am still using [_Sieve Method_](https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Sieve_method) to test each number. 
Enjoy to try reset or change input with any number that you want

## Canvas
This is what I got when I learn canvas html tag, I made some enjoyable project to kill you time

### Color Touch
Touch anywhere and the color will change

### Rain Balls
I have been really curious with any dropping balls animation, so I learn _physics_ to understand the theory of gravity
then I put it's theory into my program to create my dropping balls

click anywhere and a ball with appear right at that point and it's start to fall, then bounce when touch the ground. 
Click more and more until it's like rain balls. Don't forget to try _Free Fall_ feature when you have lots balls

### Gravity Balls
I change gravity point into center of the page, and I create line for each ball so you can see the direction each ball

It's really need effort and tricky to manipulate _theory of gravity_ for this project, but It's worth it

Enjoy it

### Drawing Fun
Try to click and drag your mouse, don't forget to click _auto width_ feature and see what happen on your colorfull line
