## Math

### Prime Number
In general, you can define a number as a prime number if it's only have two factor, that is 1 and it's self

I'll give you some example: 
```
factor number 2 is 1 and 2
factor number 7 is 1 and 7
factor number 19 is 1 and 19
...etc
```
When you want to check a number is prime or not, 
let _p_ be a number you wanna to test, you need iteration program to test from 1 to _p_ to divided _p_
if more than two number can divided _p_ than _p_ is not prime
otherwise _p_ is prime

I made a program to check prime number, I'm not using iteration program above, 
but I'll check prime number using [_Sieve Method_](https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Sieve_method), it will check prime number really fast

You can check my program in [here](https://codepen.io/colorcreate/pen/BOzKXq), if it's prime, it will tell you that it's prime number,
but when it's not prime, it will show you factors of it's number

### Prime Count
It's like _Prime Number Program_ but it's find the next prime number from input.
I am still using [_Sieve Method_](https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Sieve_method) to test each number. 
Enjoy to try reset or change input with any number that you want
